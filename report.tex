%
% This example file demonstrates the use of the 'sig-alternate.cls'
% V2.5 LaTeX2e document class file. It is for those submitting
% articles to ACM Conference Proceedings WHO DO NOT WISH TO
% STRICTLY ADHERE TO THE SIGS (PUBS-BOARD-ENDORSED) STYLE.
% The 'sig-alternate.cls' file will produce a similar-looking,
% albeit, 'tighter' paper resulting in, invariably, fewer pages.
%
% ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
% This .tex file (and associated .cls V2.5) produces:
%       1) The Permission Statement
%       2) The Conference (location) Info information
%       3) The Copyright Line with ACM data
%       4) NO page numbers
%
% as against the acm_proc_article-sp.cls file which
% DOES NOT produce 1) thru' 3) above.
%
% Using 'sig-alternate.cls' you have control, however, from within
% the source .tex file, over both the CopyrightYear
% (defaulted to 200X) and the ACM Copyright Data
% (defaulted to X-XXXXX-XX-X/XX/XX).
% e.g.
% \CopyrightYear{2007} will cause 2007 to appear in the copyright line.
% \crdata{0-12345-67-8/90/12} will cause 0-12345-67-8/90/12 to appear in the copyright line.

% REMEMBER HOWEVER: After having produced the .bbl file,
% and prior to final submission, you *NEED* to 'insert'

\title{A Sensemaking Approach to Continuous Integration}
%
% You need the command \numberofauthors to handle the 'placement
% and alignment' of the authors beneath the title.
%
% For aesthetic reasons, we recommend 'three authors at a time'
% i.e. three 'name/affiliation blocks' be placed beneath the title.
%
% NOTE: You are NOT restricted in how many 'rows' of
% "name/affiliations" may appear. We just ask that you restrict
% the number of 'columns' to three.
%
% Because of the available 'opening page real-estate'
% we ask you to refrain from putting more than six authors
% (two rows with three columns) beneath the article title.
% More than six makes the first-page appear very cluttered indeed.
%
% Use the \alignauthor commands to handle the names
% and affiliations for an 'aesthetic maximum' of six authors.
% Add names, affiliations, addresses for
% the seventh etc. author(s) as the argument for the
% \additionalauthors command.
% These 'additional authors' will be output/set for you
% without further effort on your part as the last section in
% the body of your article BEFORE References or any Appendices.

\numberofauthors{2} %  in this sample file, there are a *total*
% of EIGHT authors. SIX appear on the 'first-page' (for formatting
% reasons) and the remaining two appear in the \additionalauthors section.

\author{
% You can go ahead and credit any number of authors here,
% e.g. one 'row of three' or two rows (consisting of one row of three
% and a second row of one, two or three).
%
% The command \alignauthor (no curly braces needed) should
% precede each author name, affiliation/snail-mail address and

\section{Introduction}
Continous Integration describes a set of software engineering practices that speed up the delivery of software by automating the integration and build steps of the software development cycle. It emerged in the Extreme Programming (XP) community, with Kent Beck and Ron Jeffries writing about agile development models and continuous integration while on the Chrysler Comprehensive Compensation System project in 1998 \cite{beck:extreme_programming} \cite{beck:agile_manifesto}.

Martin Fowler further described the concept of continuous integration in 2006, by defining \textit{continuous integration} as:
\begin{quote}
Continuous Integration is a software development practice where members of a team integrate their work frequently, usually each person integrates at least daily -- leading to multiple integrations per day. Each integration is verified by an automated build (including test) to detect errors as quickly as possible. Many teams find that this approach leads to significantly reduced integration problems and allows a team to develop cohesive software more rapidly. \cite{fowler:continuous}
\end{quote}

\section{Background and Related Work}
\section{Methodology}
To answer our research questions, we conducted semi-structured interviews, wherein we asked a list of pre-set questions and inquired further with follow-up questions to learn more about each participant. \\

\begin{table*}
\label{table:codeset}
\centering
\caption{Codeset}
\begin{tabular}[b]{ | l | l | p{5.5cm} | p{6.5cm} | }
	\hline
	\rowcolor{black!20!} Code & Code Name & Description & Rules / Examples \\ \hline
	EDS & External Data Sources & Raw evidence in mostly standard consumable formats (text). & Existing external artifacts associated with software development (i.e. source code, test suites, databases, raw data, servers, etc.) \\ \hline
	SHOE & Shoebox & Much smaller subset of that external data that is relevant for processing. & Modifications to source code or testing artifacts (i.e. commits, changesets, updates) \\ \hline
	EVID & Evidence File & Snippets extracted from items in the shoebox. & Integration, compilation, and building actions related to modification and changes \\ \hline
	SCHM & Schema & Re-representation or organized marshalling of the information so that it can be used more easily to draw conclusions. & Results of integration, compilation, building, and updating (i.e. build reports, metrics, status dashboards, etc.) \\ \hline
	HYPO & Hypothesis & Tentative representation of those conclusions with supporting arguments. & Assumptions regarding integration, compilation, and builds, or conclusions drawn from the results of such actions \\ \hline
	PRES & Presentation & The final work product which is suited for communication. & Final software product, successfully build product, or deployment to customers \\ \hline
\end{tabular}
\end{table*}

We interviewed 6 participants, each of whom had at least three years software development experience. Participant information is detailed in table **Participants. Participant roles in the software development process varied. For instance, one participant (\cpg) was a founding member of a startup who managed the development team, while another participant (\david) worked for an international software company. The average experience level with software development was **x years, with a maximum of **x. All participants were required to have at least some experience with continuous integration; no minimum level was required.
\begin{table}

\begin{tabular}{ | p{.2\columnwidth} | p{.2\columnwidth} | p{.2\columnwidth} | p{.2\columnwidth} | }\hline
	Participant number & Development experience & continuous integration experience & position \\ \hline
	\michael & 1 & 1 & 1 \\ \hline

	\david & 5 & 5 & 5 \\ \hline
	\cpg & 6 & 6 & 6 \\ \hline
\end{tabular}
\end{table}
Our semi-structured interviews took place in person in a conference room at an engineering center. The exception was \cpg, who was interviewed at their place of work. Interviews lasted an average of 30 minutes, with a minimum of 8 minutes. All interviews were audio recorded with permission from participants.  Interviews began with demographic questions: participant development experience, and experience with continuous integration. We also asked a thematic question:

\smallskip
\textit{"Tell me about the last time you used continuous integration"}


For the rest of the interview, participants referred back to that experience with continuous integration. Here are some sample questions we used to get information about participants' sensemaking behavior:
\begin{itemize}  
	\item What tasks prompt you to interact with your current CI tools?
	\item What outside information do you use to evaluate the information provided by your CI solution?
	\item What types of information from your CI solution do you find relevant to you? 
\end{itemize}
\subsection{Analysis}
After transcribing the interviews, we analyzed them by using a code set based on Pirolli and Card's sensemaking model \cite{pirolli:sensemaking}. We operationalized the steps in the sensemaking model as described in Table \ref{table:codeset}. Participant transcripts were analyzed at the sentence level. We limited codes to one count of each code per sentence; if a sentence mentioned EDS twice, for example, only one instance was coded. Multiple code types were allowed for each sentence. We coded 20.37\% of participant data and reached 80.8\% agreement, measured using the Jaccard index. After that, participant data was coded independently.

\section{Results}

\subsection{RQ1:  Does Pirolli's Sensemaking Model apply to Continuous Integration?}
\subsection{RQ2: Does Continuous Integration alter the programmer's sensemaking behavior?}
\subsection{RQ3: Does Continuous Integration alter programmer's frame of reference when sensemaking?}
Our last research question is about the programmer's frame of reference when sensemaking. According to Pirolli's model, sensemaking occurs at all of the levels of the sensemaking chart. We want to understand whether or not participants framed their sensemaking as something \textit{they} were doing, or if they found that their continuous integration solution helped them perform their sensemaking.

When participants responded to questions, they often referred to the project they were working on. When coding, if participants referred to an artifact of the project, we called that an external data source. For instance, \srutitwo  said of commit messages: 

\begin{quote}
"The commit messages have been  useful."
\end{quote}


If, however, the participant referred to an action relating to the artifact, we coded that as shoeboxing. For instance, when asked when she interacted with the continuous integration solution, \srutitwo responded: 

\begin{quote}
"Every time I commit."	
\end{quote}


We found that when talking about external data sources  or their shoebox, participants were talking about things that \textit{they} did (e.g., committing, changing code). This indicated to us that the participants felt that they had to make sense of the development cycle when they were doing these tasks. 

However, we found that when referring to schemas and evidence files, participants were referring to things the CI tool did for them (e.g.,Integration testing, build reports, dashboards, etc.
) 

From these observations, we speculate that participants limited their frame of reference while sensemaking to everyday development activities, e.g. coding. This might be because the continuous integration cycle focuses on small, rapid releases rather than larger, feature-based releases. for instance, \cpg stated:

\begin{quote}
"There's really no huge formal 'we're doing a release.' We are releasing every single day. Sometimes little things, sometimes big things."	
\end{quote}


This smaller release cycle allowed participants to skip or reduce the amount of time they spent in the sensemaking steps of evidence file and schema.

\subsection{Type Changes and {\subsecit Special} Characters}
We have already seen several typeface changes in this sample.  You
can indicate italicized words or phrases in your text with
the command \texttt{{\char'134}textit}; emboldening with the
command \texttt{{\char'134}textbf}
and typewriter-style (for instance, for computer code) with
\texttt{{\char'134}texttt}.  But remember, you do not
have to indicate typestyle changes when such changes are
part of the \textit{structural} elements of your
article; for instance, the heading of this subsection will
be in a sans serif\footnote{A third footnote, here.
Let's make this a rather short one to
see how it looks.} typeface, but that is handled by the
document class file. Take care with the use
of\footnote{A fourth, and last, footnote.}
the curly braces in typeface changes; they mark
the beginning and end of
the text that is to be in the different typeface.

You can use whatever symbols, accented characters, or
non-English characters you need anywhere in your document;
you can find a complete list of what is
available in the \textit{\LaTeX\
User's Guide} cite Lamport:LaTeX.
