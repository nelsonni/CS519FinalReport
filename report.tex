%%%%The problem
Continuous integration is gaining traction as part of the push for agile software development, but little work has been done to understand the impact on developers' sensemaking processes.
%%%%Why it matters
This gap in understanding makes it difficult to assess the effectiviness of tools and techniques developed to augment and assist developers using continuous integration. Without thorough understanding of the underlying usage patterns and goals, any improvements to the tools could be to the detriment of developers using them.

%%%%Here's what we did
 In this paper, we interview 6 professional developers and examine the ways in which they adhere to current sensemaking models when using continuous integration in the context of software development. We observe that continuous integration alters the locale of responsibility for certain portions of the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC)\cite{singh:lifecycle}, including Testing, Deployment, and Maintenance. We also present a modification to Pirolli and Card's \textit{Notional Model of Sensemaking}\cite{pirolli:sensemaking}, which reflects the altered approach to sensemaking that occurs when using continuous integration in a software development context.

\section{Introduction}
Agile development models have replaced traditional development models in a significant portion of the professional software development industry. Software development companies are integrating these models in order to gain flexibility, speed, and quality, and reduce time, complexity, and errors in their software products. Continuous integration, as a common element of agile development, is being included in these strageties as companies look to streamline their processes across the Software Development Life Cycle.\cite{singh:lifecycle} Continuous integration is currently in practice at major companies such as Facebook, Google, Netflix, and LinkedIn.

Continous Integration describes a set of software engineering practices that speed up the delivery of software by automating the integration and build steps of the software development cycle. It emerged in the Extreme Programming (XP) community, with Kent Beck and Ron Jeffries writing about agile development models and continuous integration while on the Chrysler Comprehensive Compensation System project in 1998\cite{beck:extreme_programming}\cite{beck:agile_manifesto}.

Martin Fowler further described the concept of continuous integration in 2006, by defining \textit{continuous integration} as:
\begin{quote}
``Continuous Integration is a software development practice where members of a team integrate their work frequently, usually each person integrates at least daily -- leading to multiple integrations per day. Each integration is verified by an automated build (including test) to detect errors as quickly as possible. Many teams find that this approach leads to significantly reduced integration problems and allows a team to develop cohesive software more rapidly.''\cite{fowler:continuous}
\end{quote}

Little research has been done, though, to understand its effect on developers. In order to have an informed discussion about the actualized benefits and realized detriments inherent to continuous integration, we must first understanding the motivations, methods, and usage associated with it.

Previous studies on continuous integration have focused on the operational and integrational aspects of using continuous integration as part of an agile software development process\cite{miller:hundreddays}\cite{olsson:climbingstairway}, use within open source projects\cite{deshpande:ci_opensource}, or as a foil for comparison between traditional and agile development models\cite{staahl:modelingdiffs}. There are no studies that examine the effects continuous integration has on sensemaking and comprehension for software development tasks.

In this paper we attempt to evaluate whether Peter Pirolli and Stuart Card's \textit{Notional Model of Sensemaking}\cite{pirolli:sensemaking} can be applied to the use of continuous integration, whether the use of continuous integration in software development alters the previously observed model, and whether the use of continuous integration achieves the goals that professional software developers strive for when integrating continuous integration into their development processes.

Development tools are only helpful when used by software developers, therefore the adoption of these tools is critical for their success. Tool developers must understand the needs and usage patterns of their users

Learning how developers' comprehend and evaluate their software development processes when continuous integration tools and processes are employed will allow tool designers to better target perspective users.

This study is an attempt to learn more about software developers' sensemaking processes and their association with continuous integration. To that end, we look for answers to the following research questions:
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{RQ1:} Does Pirolli and Card's Sensemaking Model apply to Continuous Integration?
\item \textbf{RQ2:} Does Continuous Integration alter programmers' sensemaking behavior?
\item \textbf{RQ3:} Does the use of continuous integration aid developers in making sense of their software development cycles?

\end{itemize}

\section{Background and Related Work}

\subsection{Background}

The Software Development Life Cycle consists of six steps: \textit{Requirements Analysis}, \textit{Design}, \textit{Development}, \textit{Testing}, \textit{Deployment}, and \textit{Maintenance}. Continuous integration specifically alters the \textit{Testing}, \textit{Deployment} and \textit{Maintenance} phases. According to the ISO/IEC 12207 standard\cite{singh:lifecycle}, once requirements have been gathered, analyzed, and a technical design has been determined, the development and testing phases will begin to be the primary focus of a software development project.

The \textit{Testing} phase occurs once the application is migrate to a test environment where different types of testing will be performed, including integration and system testing. These tests typically check for errors, bugs, and interoperability issues. Continuous integration tools allow tests suites to be augmented with different target environments and automatically verified for interoperability without the need for developers to manually conduct such tests.

The \textit{Deployment} phase is considered the final stage of initial development, and is where software is put into production use. Continuous integration, especially when part of a solution that included continuous deployment, allows new or updated software to quickly be packaged for deployment without requiring direct input from developers. This packaging can include multiple versions that are targeted at different platforms, and is a target for significant time and cost savings.

The \textit{Maintenance} phase is required to continually operate software at peak performance levels. During this phase, the system and software is assessed to ensure that it does not become obsolete, software patches are generated to add functionality, fix bugs or resolve potential security issues. Continuous integration offers the ability to quickly test, validate, and package these patches for deployment without requiring direct input from developers.

The use of continuous integration offloads certain aspects of the Software Development Life Cycle that would typically be conducted by human developers, and instead tasks machines and software with their execution. Since the locale of responsibility for these actions are removed from the developer, their sensemaking models are also subsequently altered.

For our work, we used Pirolli and Card's \textit{Notional Model of Sensemaking}\cite{pirolli:sensemaking} as the basis of our analysis into the sensemaking model that developers use during the Software Development Life Cycle. This model was derived from observations conducted using intelligence analysts, considered experts for the purposes of their study, and focused upon the intrinsic steps conducted when searching, evaluating, and deriving conclusions from information within the analyst's field of inquiry. These types of tasks, the expert behavior of analysts, and the nature of their sensemaking provide parallels to our target group which we used to build our study. Professional software developers can be considered to use expert behavior in their programming tasks, which also require searching, evaluating, and deriving conclusions when designing, developing, testing, and deploying software.

\subsection{Related Work}

Prior work on continuous integration has focused on the operational and integrational aspects of using continuous integration.

A. Miller\cite{miller:hundreddays} provided an experiental case study of using continuous integration. He provided analysis about the effectiviness of using continuous integration from the perspective of a system administrator that is tasked with building and deploying a Continuous Integration (CI) server within a distributed software development team environment. This contrasts with our work to understand the usage of continuous integration by developers after a Continuous Integration (CI) server or service has been deployed, and without regard to the maintenance of such a system.

H. H. Olsson, et al.\cite{olsson:climbingstairway} conducted case studies on the steps, barriers, and experiences of software development teams migrating from traditional development models to agile development models. They provided a stepped transition model that included continuous integration as an individual step along the path to employing a full agile development model. For the purposes of their study, continuous integration was another step in a larger context of process migration, and examined from the perspective of business and operations managers. We focus upon the developer and their experiences when using continuous integration tools and methods, and not in regards to transitioning across a spectrum of agile methods.

A. Deshpande and D. Riehle\cite{deshpande:ci_opensource} analyzed fine-grained data from code repositories in order to understand the impact of continuous integration within the open source community. In contrast to our work, they focus on whether the use of continuous integration alters how and when developers contribute code to open source projects. We look at the effects continuous integration has upon patterns associated with information seeking, evaluation, and understanding. Our work attempts to explain how continuous integration can effect the steps taken to develop software, irregardless of the effects to developer communities.

D. St{\aa}hl and J. Bosch\cite{staahl:modelingdiffs} focus on the inputs, outputs, and dependency implications of continuous integration use in comparisons across industries and contextual applications of agile development models. Again, this work focuses on continuous integration at the team and business level, with particular attention paid to the implementation and integration of new operational models. Our work looks at the internal scope of individual developers working with already deployed continuous integration tools and services.

\end{tabular}
\end{table*}

To answer our research questions, we conducted semi-structured interviews, wherein we asked a list of pre-set questions and inquired further with follow-up questions to learn more about each participant.

We interviewed 6 participants, each of whom had at least three years software development experience. Participant information is detailed in table \ref{table:participant}. Participant roles in the software development process varied. For instance, one participant (\cpg) was a founding member of a startup who managed the development team, while another participant (\david) worked for an international software company. The average experience level with software development was **x years, with a maximum of **x. All participants were required to have at least some experience with continuous integration; no minimum level was required.

\end{tabular}
\end{table}

Our semi-structured interviews took place in person in a conference room at an engineering center. The exception was \cpg, who was interviewed at their place of work. Interviews lasted an average of 30 minutes, with a minimum of 8 minutes. All interviews were audio recorded with permission from participants.  Interviews began with demographic questions: participant development experience, and experience with continuous integration. We also asked a thematic question:

\smallskip
\textit{"Tell me about the last time you used continuous integration"}


For the rest of the interview, participants referred back to that experience with continuous integration. Here are some sample questions we used to get information about participants' sensemaking behavior:
\begin{itemize}  
	\item What tasks prompt you to interact with your current CI tools?
	\item What outside information do you use to evaluate the information provided by your CI solution?
	\item What types of information from your CI solution do you find relevant to you? 
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Analysis}
After transcribing the interviews, we analyzed them by using a code set based on Pirolli and Card's sensemaking model \cite{pirolli:sensemaking}. We operationalized the steps in the sensemaking model as described in Table \ref{table:codeset}. Participant transcripts were analyzed at the sentence level. We limited codes to one count of each code per sentence; if a sentence mentioned EDS twice, for example, only one instance was coded. Multiple code types were allowed for each sentence. We coded 20.37\% of participant data and reached 80.8\% agreement, measured using the Jaccard index. After that, participant data was coded independently.

	\end{tabular}
\end{table}
Our last research question is about the programmer's frame of reference when sensemaking. To answer this question, we coded participant interviews as described in methodology. Table \ref{table:coderesults} details our results.  According to Pirolli's model, sensemaking occurs at all of the levels of the sensemaking chart. We want to understand whether or not participants framed their sensemaking as something \textit{they} were doing, or if they found that their continuous integration solution helped them perform their sensemaking.

We found that participants didn't refer to hypotheses and presentation nearly as much as they referred to external data sources, shoeboxing, evidence files, and schema. We interpret this result to mean that participants spend less time hypothesizing about their project or thinking about presentation because of continuous integration. The tools that continuous integration uses influenced the way that participants described their work.

When participants responded to questions, they often referred to the project they were working on. When coding, if participants referred to an artifact of the project, we called that an external data source. For instance, \srutitwo  said of commit messages: 

\begin{quote}
"The commit messages have been  useful."
\end{quote}


If, however, the participant referred to an action relating to the artifact, we coded that as shoeboxing. For instance, when asked when she interacted with the continuous integration solution, \srutitwo responded: 

\begin{quote}
"Every time I commit."	
\end{quote}

We found that when talking about external data sources  or their shoebox, participants were talking about things that \textit{they} did (e.g., committing, changing code). This indicated to us that the participants felt that they had to make sense of the development cycle when they were doing these tasks. 

However, we found that when referring to schemas and evidence files, participants were referring to things the CI tool did for them (e.g.,Integration testing, build reports, dashboards, etc.
) 

From these observations, we speculate that participants limited their frame of reference while sensemaking to everyday development activities, e.g. coding. This might be because the continuous integration cycle focuses on small, rapid releases rather than larger, feature-based releases. for instance, \cpg stated:

\begin{quote}
"There's really no huge formal 'we're doing a release.' We are releasing every single day. Sometimes little things, sometimes big things."	
\end{quote}


This smaller release cycle allowed participants to skip or reduce the amount of time they spent in the sensemaking steps of evidence file and schema. 

\subsection{RQ3: Does the use of continuous integration aid developers in making sense of their software development cycles?}
We've presented evidence that continuous integration changes the way that developers make sense of their software development cycle. but the question remains: are these changes good or bad? If continuous integration is helping developers make sense of their projects, we need to be able to identify and capitalize on its strengths.
We found that continuous integration helped participants understand their projects. \srutitwo pointed out that having continuous integration reports helped the development team understand what has changed in a project:
\begin{quote}
	Sometimes we just like looking at those reports \ldots it tells a lot about what has been happening  in a project.  
\end{quote}
\caius noted that the continuous integration tools helped them understand what caused problems in their build:
\begin{quote}
	\caius: But it's just that if I screw something up, I find it earlier and it [the CI tool] gives me more to look at.
	
	\caius: In [CI tool], ... the emails that comes would give me more information. ... I could just look at the email and see "well, this test failed." It would just make my life easy, because then I don't have to go hunt for ... the cause
\end{quote}
\david mentioned that understanding the overall project was easier with continuous integration tools:
\begin{quote}
	\david: it gave me a chance to understand how different modules within the project would interact with one another, and verify that my understanding was good
\end{quote}

Participants made sense of their projects in several ways through the use of continuous integration. It helped them understand key aspects of their projects and make sense of the problems that occurred during development. 
\section{Discussion}
\subsection{Threats to Validity}
Our study has some threats to validity that need to be addressed. First is our sample size: we only had 6 participants, and they may not be representative of continuous integration users in general. Beyond that, our participants may have had recollection bias: it's possible that during the interview, participants were more likely to recall information that had to do with their day-to-day work, such as programming, and less likely to remember their hypotheses and final product. This could influence the proportion of codes we found in the interviews. Finally, participants may have exhibited bias for or against continuous integration based on factors outside their sensemaking process, such as work environment or project workload.
\subsection{Future Work}
As previously indicated, there is a lack of literature focusing on the role of continuous integration within models of cognition and understanding as it relates to software development. Future work could further analyze the role continuous integration has on our modified model of sensemaking by performing observational studies on people interacting with continuous integration tools. 

Further work could also be done by applying Information Foraging Theory to try to understand the effects of continuous integration tools on developers' foraging habits. 

Finally, while our work explores how continuous integration affects sensemaking, we've only done preliminary work. We don't answer questions such as "why does continuous integration affect sensemaking," and we don't address whether or not these effects are beneficial or harmful to users. 
\section{Conclusion}
This study is the first that considers continuous integration through the lens of sensemaking. We interviewed 6 software developers about their experience with continuous integration. Results indicate that there are key elements of the sensemaking process that continuous integration affects. Our key results were:
\begin{itemize}  
	\item \textit{Modifying Pirolli and Card's notional model of sensemaking:} We found some differences in the way that developers make sense of the development cycle when using continuous integration. This prompted us to modify Pirolli and Card's model to fit our participants' experiences.
	\item \textit{Continuous Integration tools change participant behavior during sensemaking:} Participants referred to their hypotheses and presentation steps of sensemaking much less often than they referred to external data sources, shoebox, evidence file, and schema. We thing that continuous integration tools cause participants to spend less time hypothesizing about and presenting their work. 
	\item \textit{An altered frame of reference:} Continuous integration tools seemed to take over part of participants' sensemaking process, specifically by providing them evidence files and schemas by which to refer to their development projects.
